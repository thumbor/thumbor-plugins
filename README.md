## üö® Breaking change

This repository used to be released under a single package in previous
versions, `thumbor-plugins`.

We broke down into multiple packages to make it easier for developers to
contribute, test, and use different versions.

For example, the mozjpeg optimizer is released on the package
`thumbor-plugins-mozjpeg`, and the Gifv one on the package
`thumbor-plugins-gifv`.
